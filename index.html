                    "A critical element to understanding any literacy
                    technology is to understand how even the newest digital media
                    is intertwined with older media and the cussedness of human
                    (in)decision (See Fig. 2). In this writing project, I am
                    asking you to historicize a soft Web technology and the
                    complexity of human decision-making driving its development."

                <p>
                  The &lt;blockquote&gt; in HTML is an interesting element,
                  based off of and meant to emulate in style and role of a
                  particular element in printed text. While it was semantically
                  intended or a specific purpose like its predecessor, the
                  manner in which it styles text and the cultural knowledge of
                  quotations in writing gave it a more varied usage, depending
                  on the user's own perceptions and needs. While the alternative
                  uses go against the proper semantics that were laid out for
                  it by developers, the adaptation of this element is in line
                  with the realities of the relationship people have with
                  technologies. By historicizing the blockquote, one can see how
                  the blockquote is shaped by culture and old technologies that
                  were before it in print.

                                The blockquote element was introduced in the HTML
                                4.01 specification by the World Wide Web
                                Consortium in December 1999. Under the description
                                within W3C’s recommendation, blockquote is one of
                                the elements that handles the structure of text
                                and is classified as a block-level element. Block-
                                level elements will usually display new line and
                                take up the space of its parent container, making
                                a “block”. A conspicuous example of this is
                                blockquote itself, which requires starting a new
                                line and filling up its parent container to
                                separate its content as a quote from other
                                content. This is different from the other type,
                                inline elements, which can only take up what is
                                within its tags, but can be displayed anywhere on
                                a line without the need to start a new one, such
                                as italics or emphasis.
                              </p>

                                Returning to the topic of the
                                recommendation by W3C, this difference between
                                block-level and inline-level content helps to
                                distinguish the blockquote and the q element, the
                                both of which share a similar function: the
                                blockquote is a block-level element for longer
                                quotations, while the q element is an inline
                                element for shorter quotes (W3C, 1993).
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                In plain HTML, the usage of the blockquote
                                element in rendered text would be indicated by
                                the start of a new line and the indentation of
                                the text. With Bootstrap, it gets a little more
                                decorative, as shown here:

                                Since the language of both quotations is American
                                English, user agents should render them
                                appropriately, for example with single quote marks
                                around the inner quotation and double quote marks
                                around the outer quotation…

								              <p>
                                When HTML 5 was created, the blockquote element
                                was included for legacy purposes [1]. Also,
                                according to mailing lists from when HTML 5 was
                                still in development in 2012 by the WHAT Working
                                Group, there was a discussion on setting up the
                                specification for proper usage of blockquote by
                                having it semantically require citations for the
                                quoted content. Or rather, the discussion in
                                some parts devolved into squabble on why effort
                                should be put into a legacy element and make it
                                more proper tool when often, it was noted to be
                                used used more for indentation than actual
                                quotations [2].
                              </p>

                                The exchange of emails also
                                involved topics of consistency, semantics, and
                                concerns of “proper authoring”. This was met
                                with some difficulties for actually making it
                                more proper as a writing tool, with some. It is
                                also noted in the mailing list that it would be
                                “annoying” as some put it, to make the
                                specification closer in line to how traditional
                                manuals of style dictate block quotations,
                                notably the Chicago Manual of Style which is
                                often used for most publications. The member of
                                the WHATWG mailing list who commented on it as
                                such, Oli Studholme, even wrote his own article
                                listing what the Chicago Manual of Style
                                requires for a traditional block quotation, many
                                of which would be impossible (2011). There
                                also was a lack of deeper examination into the
                                use cases of blockquote beyond the awareness of
                                inconsistencies in citation within the element
                                and the acknowledgement of real-life cases for
                                blockquote (noted as different from the use
                                cases they had originally discussed) [4].

                              <p>
                                In the end, they decide that the original
                                markup should remain intact, as CSS can handle
                                the presentation of it. There is no absolute
                                documentation of the disagreements being fully
                                resolved. However, they do add onto its
                                definition from the HTML 4 specification,
                                including that text within the blockquote
                                element should be an outside-sourced quotation
                                with a source for where the quoted text is taken
                                from. The source should be then framed with the
                                &lt;cite&gt; element (WHATWG, 2015).

                                Block quotations would appear to be what the
                                markup of blockquote is based on. The usage of
                                block quotations is intended for quoting from an
                                outside source, where the quoted text is usually
                                more than one hundred words or takes up at least
                                four lines of indented text. The purpose of the
                                block quotation is to present a longer quote as
                                significant evidence. Thus, when used in a
                                document, they would have rhetorical value for
                                the reader through the rhetorical appeals of
                                ethos or logos.

                                Due to how a block quotation can be
                                abused in writing to fill up space in the
                                writer’s stead, there are many guidelines to
                                how it should be properly used in a document.
                                With that in mind, it seemed that the blockquote
                                was meant more to represent a block quote in
                                visual presentation rather than the actual
                                mechanics and guidelines to it. Due to their
                                unwieldiness in text, especially in professional
                                and academic papers, block quotation in such
                                have become less common in them. This may be due
                                to belief that they are excessive compared to
                                shorter quotations and seen as a practice of

                                In studies that
                                compared the direct quotation practices in low-
                                and high-rated theses, the latter had shorter
                                quotations, but were used more prolifically,
                                with stronger justification for their usage.
                                (Petric, 2012). Block quotations can be more
                                awkward to justify their purpose in a paper,
                                compared to shorter quotations. There is also
                                the concern of plagiarism, where writers worry
                                that longer quotations and the obscure block
                                quotation are more likely to be improperly
                                formatted and at a higher risk of being cited
                                for plagiarism (Henige, 2006).

                                Pull quotes are a type of visual or design
                                element also found in print, but mainly in
                                journalism and magazines. They create a focal
                                point for the reader by pulling from its own
                                source text a quote, an excerpt, or a key phrase
                                and using that as a graphical element placed on
                                the page, emphasizing it through changes in
                                design and typography from the regular text
                                (Strizver, 2010).

                                Their purpose is for adding
                                point of interest or visual design to a
                                document, but they also have been found to have
                                a strong rhetorical impact on the audience. In
                                some cases, they can also shape the reader’s
                                perception on the document through the
                                availability heuristics that reader use
                                subconsciously to absorb information, according
                                to one study from the Newspaper Research Journal
                                (Gibson et al., 2001).

                                Like block quotations,
                                they are a page element that contributes the
                                rhetorical impact of a page. While there is no
                                HTML tag for pull quotes specifically, writers
                                and designers do continue the practice of using
                                pull quotes on the web. There, the role of pull
                                quotes is looser compared to how it’s used in
                                print, partly due to the more visually-oriented
                                nature of web design.

                                Currently on the web, blockquote has been used
                                in ways outside of both specifications by W3C and
                                WHATWG. Obviously, it can still be used as it was
                                intended, which would include a proper citation
                                like the HTML 5 specification recommends.
                                However, in the realm of web writing, that is a
                                very niche purpose for a surprisingly versatile
                                element, as people with some knowledge of how to
                                use HTML and CSS have found.

                                One mundane usage
                                of the blockquote element is to function as
                                indentation for text. The WHATWG mailing list
                                noted that during development that simple text
                                indentation was a very common way to use
                                blockquote, which led to heated discussion on
                                semantics. This is a completely incorrect way to
                                use blockquote that defies the recommendations,
                                but due to how it does indent the text
                                naturally, it has been used for that purpose as
                                a typing shortcut when there is limited knowledge
                                on text structure in HTML.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Another usage of the
                                blockquote tag is creating pull quotes. This
                                practice is common on web articles for news
                                websites, such as this pull quote from a BBC
                                article, created with the blockquote element
                                according the page source:
                              </p>

                                Because they are quotations from within the
                                text instead of an outside source and would not
                                have the attribution without being redundant,
                                using the blockquote element for pull quote is
                                also considered incorrect usage, according to
                                its definition as a semantic HTML element.

                                The "misuse" of blockquote is often not one with
                                malevolent intentions, or even realized as
                                misuse in many cases by the user. A person would
                                have to know the specification of blockquote to
                                realize the latter, and to put it bluntly,
                                looking up specifications is not always
                                necessary when the creation of web content is
                                so streamlined by modern technology that broad
                                audience can accomplish such a task, sometimes
                                without ever needing to see a line of HTML code.

                                Due to that, one cause of this problem is
                                through how blockquote is presented to the
                                regular audience. A way to think of this issue
                                is as such: a person would likely require
                                background knowledge of HTML to use blockquote
                                in a semantically correct manner, however, that
                                knowledge isn’t required at all for a person to
                                use the blockquote element in the way they
                                find appropriate for their needs.
                              </p>

                                Blockquote is a common feature of many rich text
                                editors, an interface that simplifies writing
                                for web content with a live preview and editing
                                of rendered text without the writer needing to
                                type in code, also known as “what you see is
                                what you get” (WYSIWYG). Often there is little
                                context for what this blockquote button does,
                                except that the visual rhetoric of quotation
                                marks would imply that it’s used for some sort
                                of quotation, and using it on the rich text
                                would only give a surface-level response as to
                                what it does.

                                from expert to expert. A technology that can be
                                seen a somewhat encouraging the idea that
                                blockquote can be used for quotes is CSS itself.
                                With the use of CSS, a blockquote can transforms
                                from indented text to a rhetorically functional
                                visual element, with details such as enlarged
                                quotation marks, a colored box for a background,
                                and so on. While a person can definitely make a
                                semantically correct blockquote while applying
                                CSS to make it a more reader-friendly element,
                                often that isn’t the case. A quotation with the
                                purpose of supporting an argument through logos
                                wouldn’t need the pathos kind of appeal that a
                                blockquote with CSS can provide.
                              </p>

                                The third
                                reason is that the blockquote element in any web
                                writing practice is done based off of the
                                traditional print practices of the block
                                quotation and pull quote. Both are functional
                                practices of writing for printed documents,
                                however they serve different purposes are found
                                in different fields of writing. What they do
                                have in common is that they are a quotation
                                added to a text, something that the blockquote
                                element can do for web writing.

                                The term "practice" within this historicizing
                                context refers to a conceptual framework
                                proposed by Sylvia Scribner and Michael Cole,
                                two literary reseachers whose theorized concept
                                of this practice put the "technology" of writing
                                under a whole new light. The practice of writing
                                goes beyond the general understanding that it's
                                a practical technical skill. On a deeper level,
                                writing has strong, dynamic connections to the
                                environment where it is used and the underlying
                                context of its usage, including culturally-
                                shared knowledge, other technologies, and
                                present sign-systems (1981).

                                Historicizing the blockquote provides evidence
                                supporting the idea of writing as a practice,
                                dynamic in nature and influenced by context. In
                                this situation, blockquote has been connected to
                                two different writing practices. One is the more
                                formal, academic style of writing, and the other
                                is journalistic writing. Block quotations and
                                pull quotes from their respective practices are
                                older technologies that were transferred to the
                                newer technology of web writing through the
                                blockquote element. The idea of culturally-
                                shared knowledge allowed both possible uses for
                                blockquote to thrive, regardless of semantics.

                            <p>
                              From Chapter 6 of Christina Haas' book <i>Writing
                              Technology</i>, Haas brings up two common myths of
                              technology, both of which which she then debunks
                              through her own experiences with the Andrew
                              Project at Carnegie Mellon university. These two
                              myths are that technology is self-determining and
                              that it is transparent (1996).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              The blockquote element, a soft web technology in
                              itself, also proves the two myths to be falsehoods
                              with its history. From the mailing lists that took
                              place during HTML 5's development, the blockquote
                              created confusion and some debate over how to
                              give it proper specifications when its usage was
                              noticeably inconsistent. Had blockquote been an
                              "all-powerful" and self-determining technology,
                              these exchanges of emails wouldn't have ever
                              occurred, nor would this controversy on whether
                              it's proper to use the blockquote element for
                              pull quotes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              The confusion present in some of
                              those emails on the mailing list is also one
                              aspect of blockquote's nature that disproves
                              the notion that technology is always transparent.
                              For many that go on the web, they do not think of
                              the blockquote exactly the way that the W3C
                              Recommendation describes it. More likely, if they
                              even know what a blockquote is, they would think
                              of the button containing quotation marks on a text
                              editor that they can use on their text.
                              Transparency would mean that's blockquote's
                              purpose would have been clear and undisputable
                              by any user, regardless of familiarity with it.
